# Data Science Projects
My data science projects collection. Some projects are done to fulfill college assignments, some are just for fun.

## Project List:
### [Exploratory Data Analysis on Abalone Dataset](https://github.com/hwulanayu/hwulanayu.github.io/blob/master/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20on%20Abalone%20Dataset.ipynb)
Analyze the Abalone dataset from [this site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone). The dataset is meant to predict abalone age with its physical measurement. However, we're only trying to do some EDA and test whether the PCA method can be applied to this dataset.

The project was completed as part of Computer Science's 'Data Science' course at Universitas Indonesia.

### [Real or Fake Job Posting Classifier](https://github.com/hwulanayu/hwulanayu.github.io/blob/master/Real%20or%20Fake%20Job%20Postings%20Classification%20(text%20features).ipynb)
Make classifier using Python sklearn library and Keras Neural Network with this dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction). I make two version with sklearn library, one which use only text features dataset and one with text and numerical features combined. The dataset is imbalanced, so we use f1 score metric. Turns out the highest f1 score is almost the same which is 0.92.
* [Real or Fake Job Posting Classifier with KNN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression (text features)](https://github.com/hwulanayu/hwulanayu.github.io/blob/master/Real%20or%20Fake%20Job%20Postings%20Classification%20(text%20features).ipynb)
* [Real or Fake Job Posting Classifier with KNN, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression (combined text and numerical features)](https://github.com/hwulanayu/hwulanayu.github.io/blob/master/Real%20or%20Fake%20Job%20Postings%20Classification%20(text%2Bnumeric%20features).ipynb)
* Real or Fake Job Posting Classifier with Keras (to be updated)

The project(the sklearn one) was completed as part of Computer Science's 'Data Science' course at Universitas Indonesia.
