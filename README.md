# Data Science Projects
My science data project collection. Some projects are done to fulfill college assignments, some are just for fun.

##Project List:
---------------
###Exploratory Data Analysis on Abalone Dataset
Analyze the Abalone dataset from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone. The dataset is meant to predict abalone age with its physical measurement. However, we're only trying to do some EDA and test whether the PCA method can be applied to this dataset.

The project was completed as part of Computer Science's 'Data Science' course at Universitas Indonesia.
